  <h1>2017 Partial Solar Eclipse NYC</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    <p>It has been years since the last time that I saw a partial solar eclipse in China. I remembered to look out the window of a 6-floor apartment building in an open area was pretty awesome. Plus, there had no clouds on that day, which was very rare in my hometown. The entire process didn’t last that long but enough for me to enjoy.</p>

<p>Today, I was able to see the partial solar eclipse again in NYC. People have been talking about it for weeks already. On the very day, I decided to meet up with some of my ex-colleagues for lunch at <a href="http://tinyurl.com/yct2k3cy" target="`_blank`">Friedman’s Lunch</a>. While waiting for them, some random guy on the street shouted out load about how cool his sun glasses was and showed off to some girls. To think back, I did wish that I bought a pair when it costed about $7. On the night before, the glasses listed over $500 on Amazon, which was ridiculous! The lunch spot was very popular that all seats were filled about 20 minutes past noon. We were lucky to get a table. I had this place on my wanted to try list for months and finally was able to give it a try. I ordered a grilled salmon salad, which was pretty good except too much onion and Kalamata olives. Salmon was cooked perfectly with a pink center.</p>

<p>After lunch, I went back to the office and noticed other rooms were empty. Our team was probably the only group left on the floor. I decided to join my cousin on the 10th floor, where he setup his heavy equipments for recording this once in a life time event. The sky was very clear until the solar eclipse started. Clouds just came in from no where. We got little upset but at the same time, when a thin patch of clouds passed by, we were able to see the eclipse with our naked eyes. In a way, the clouds helped. The sun looked very far compared to my first solar eclipse experience in China. Plus, we were surrounded by tall buildings in midtown Manhattan, which I felt it wasn’t as awesome as I expected. I still had fun.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, my friend contacted me and asked if he can stop by and share some desserts. I can never say no to that. He brought over the cupcake of the day from <a href="http://tinyurl.com/yayfuer">Magnolia Bakery Grand Central Terminal</a> - S’more, which was called the “eclipse” cupcake for suiting today’s event. The cupcake was made out of honey graham cake and chocolate filling with meringue icing, which wasn’t bad. My friend also got the famous classic banana pudding, which was a little too sweet for me and not enough bananas.</p>

<p>So I decided to take him to the <a href="http://tinyurl.com/ydedgkel">Little Pie Company</a>, which was about 8 blocks from my work. The banana coconut cream pie definitely tasted much better. I found out about the Little Pie Company through Sobsey’s Produce in Hoboken, who sold some of their pies. I have had the sour cream apple walnut pie (the best seller), the Montmorency cherry pie, Strawberry cheesecake and the key lime pie. The Montmorency cherry pie was definitely my favorite, which was tart but not too sugary. My husband loved the banana coconut cream pie, which was my cat Pumpkin’s favorite also! She licked the plate clean. The pie was creamy, smooth and not too sugary, and the sour cream apple walnut pie, which made out of 3 kind of apples. We were both not a big fan of the key lime pie though, which had some metal after taste. I have to go back to the Little Pie Company and try out the remaining flavors.</p>
