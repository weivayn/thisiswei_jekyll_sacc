  <h1>Hiking along the Hudson</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    <p>It was a very nice day today. After waking up, my husband and I decided to go for a hike along the Hudson River. We found <a href="https://goo.gl/FrWpAh" target="`_blank`">Carpenters’ Trail</a>, which was about 4 miles with a great view of the city.</p>

<p>We started our trip by stopping at this <a href="https://goo.gl/3ML13A" target="`_blank`">Starbucks</a>. I got a cool lime refresher, which was very refreshing for a hot summer day.</p>

<p>We started the hike from the parking area (TIPS: there was a $5 fee for parking.) and walked along the river. The view of the George Washington Bridge was stunting.</p>

<p>We spotted some interesting flowers on the way and a bunch of mushrooms. I guessed because of it rained the night before the mushrooms were growing with a rapid speed.</p>

<p>After two and half hours of hiking and passing by some waterfalls, we went back to the picnic area, where we started.</p>

<p>After the hike, we decided to visit <a href="https://goo.gl/v4wv1T" target="`_blank`">Soup Dumpling Plus</a> in Fort Lee, which I gave them a 4-star rating on Yelp. A friend of ours had mentioned quite a few times about having brunch here. We ordered 6 dishes and were pretty stuffed. The scallion pancakes, pan fried pork buns and pan fried pork dumplings were my favorite. They were crispy and tasty. Some of the buns and dumplings were very juicy, which was a hit or miss. The pork fried rice was on the dry side and lack of flavor. Eggplant with garlic sauce was too sweet and not spicy at all. I had much better steamed pork soup dumplings in Chinatown. These had thicker skins, less meat and lack of flavor.</p>
