I was able to add tags into my blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was an additional step that I took to make tags to be fully functional, which was to included &lt;strong&gt;/thisiswei&lt;/strong&gt; tag in front of the &lt;strong&gt;/tag/&lt;/strong&gt;, where I had hyperlinks or &lt;strong&gt;href&lt;/strong&gt;.
    ```
      &amp;lt;ul class=&quot;tag_list_in_post&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;    &amp;lt;li class=&quot;inline tag_list_item&quot;&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;a class=&quot;tag_list_link&quot; href=&quot;**/thisiswei**/tag/Jekyll&quot;&amp;gt;Jekyll&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
    
    &amp;lt;li class=&quot;inline tag_list_item&quot;&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;a class=&quot;tag_list_link&quot; href=&quot;**/thisiswei**/tag/Code&quot;&amp;gt;Code&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
    
  &amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, it’s time to style them!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="Jekyll" /><category term="Code" /><summary type="html">Thanks to Charlie Park’s tutorial on how to add Tags In Jekyll!

I remembered to look out the window of a 6-floor apartment building in an open area was pretty awesome. Plus- there had no clouds on that day- which was very rare in my hometown. The entire process didn’t last that long but enough for me to enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today- I was able to see the partial solar eclipse again in NYC. People have been talking about it for weeks already. On the very day- I decided to meet up with some of my ex-colleagues for lunch at &lt;a href=&quot;http://tinyurl.com/yct2k3cy&quot; target=&quot;`_blank`&quot;&gt;Friedman’s Lunch&lt;/a&gt;. While waiting for them- some random guy on the street shouted out load about how cool his sun glasses was and showed off to some girls. To think back- I did wish that I bought a pair when it costed about $7. On the night before- the glasses listed over $500 on Amazon- which was ridiculous! The lunch spot was very popular that all seats were filled about 20 minutes past noon. We were lucky to get a table. I had this place on my wanted to try list for months and finally was able to give it a try. I ordered a grilled salmon salad- which was pretty good except too much onion and Kalamata olives. Salmon was cooked perfectly with a pink center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tinyurl.com/y7xm9rrj&quot; target=&quot;`_blank`&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://tinyurl.com/y9rhtctk&quot; alt=&quot;Grilled Salmon Salad&quot; title=&quot;Grilled Salmon Salad&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After lunch- I went back to the office and noticed other rooms were empty. Our team was probably the only group left on the floor. I decided to join my cousin on the 10th floor- where he setup his heavy equipments for recording this once in a life time event. The sky was very clear until the solar eclipse started. Clouds just came in from no where. We got little upset but at the same time- when a thin patch of clouds passed by- we were able to see the eclipse with our naked eyes. In a way- the clouds helped. The sun looked very far compared to my first solar eclipse experience in China. Plus- we were surrounded by tall buildings in midtown Manhattan- which I felt it wasn’t as awesome as I expected. I still had fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the afternoon- my friend contacted me and asked if he can stop by and share some desserts. I can never say no to that. He brought over the cupcake of the day from &lt;a href=&quot;http://tinyurl.com/yayfuer&quot;&gt;Magnolia Bakery Grand Central Terminal&lt;/a&gt; - S’more- which was called the “eclipse” cupcake for suiting today’s event. The cupcake was made out of honey graham cake and chocolate filling with meringue icing- which wasn’t bad. My friend also got the famous classic banana pudding- which was a little too sweet for me and not enough bananas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tinyurl.com/y97x5ajt&quot; target=&quot;`_blank`&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://tinyurl.com/yan6heoh&quot; alt=&quot;Eclipse Cupcake&quot; title=&quot;Eclipse Cupcake&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://tinyurl.com/yddhdfmz&quot; target=&quot;`_blank`&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://tinyurl.com/yaewaycw&quot; alt=&quot;Classic Banana Pudding&quot; title=&quot;Classic Banana Pudding&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I decided to take him to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://tinyurl.com/ydedgkel&quot;&gt;Little Pie Company&lt;/a&gt;- which was about 8 blocks from my work. The banana coconut cream pie definitely tasted much better. I found out about the Little Pie Company through Sobsey’s Produce in Hoboken- who sold some of their pies. I have had the sour cream apple walnut pie (the best seller)- the Montmorency cherry pie- Strawberry cheesecake and the key lime pie. The Montmorency cherry pie was definitely my favorite- which was tart but not too sugary. My husband loved the banana coconut cream pie- which was my cat Pumpkin’s favorite also! She licked the plate clean. The pie was creamy- smooth and not too sugary- and the sour cream apple walnut pie- which made out of 3 kind of apples. We were both not a big fan of the key lime pie though- which had some metal after taste. I have to go back to the Little Pie Company and try out the remaining flavors.&lt;/p&gt;

After waking up- my husband and I decided to go for a hike along the Hudson River. We found &lt;a href=&quot;https://goo.gl/FrWpAh&quot; target=&quot;`_blank`&quot;&gt;Carpenters’ Trail&lt;/a&gt;- which was about 4 miles with a great view of the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started our trip by stopping at this &lt;a href=&quot;https://goo.gl/3ML13A&quot; target=&quot;`_blank`&quot;&gt;Starbucks&lt;/a&gt;. I got a cool lime refresher- which was very refreshing for a hot summer day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://goo.gl/o3ut2k&quot; target=&quot;`_blank`&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://goo.gl/KfUCtn&quot; alt=&quot;Cool Lime Refresher&quot; title=&quot;Cool Lime Refresher&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://goo.gl/ovEfWq&quot; target=&quot;`_blank`&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://goo.gl/XzP5mM&quot; alt=&quot;Cool Lime Refresher&quot; title=&quot;Cool Lime Refresher&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started the hike from the parking area (TIPS: there was a $5 fee for parking.) and walked along the river. The view of the George Washington Bridge was stunting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://goo.gl/h2jnEK&quot; target=&quot;`_blank`&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://goo.gl/fYeD9H&quot; alt=&quot;View of the George Washington Bridge&quot; title=&quot;View of the George Washington Bridge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://goo.gl/LD5Wub&quot; target=&quot;`_blank`&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://goo.gl/rfPHNc&quot; alt=&quot;View of the George Washington Bridge&quot; title=&quot;View of the George Washington Bridge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spotted some interesting flowers on the way and a bunch of mushrooms. I guessed because of it rained the night before the mushrooms were growing with a rapid speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://goo.gl/txvw4T&quot; target=&quot;`_blank`&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://goo.gl/M11yCF&quot; alt=&quot;Yellow Flower&quot; title=&quot;Yellow Flower&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://goo.gl/q2TPmK&quot; target=&quot;`_blank`&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://goo.gl/x23eFf&quot; alt=&quot;Purple Flower&quot; title=&quot;Purple Flower&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://goo.gl/x3gfNi&quot; target=&quot;`_blank`&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://goo.gl/qCF3p3&quot; alt=&quot;Star Shaped Flower&quot; title=&quot;Star Shaped Flower&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://goo.gl/4WN4Cr&quot; target=&quot;`_blank`&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://goo.gl/wdgarf&quot; alt=&quot;Shrooms&quot; title=&quot;Shrooms&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After two and half hours of hiking and passing by some waterfalls- we went back to the picnic area- where we started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://goo.gl/X4caje&quot; target=&quot;`_blank`&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://goo.gl/o7RQU3&quot; alt=&quot;Waterfall&quot; title=&quot;Waterfall&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;Flower Looking Plants&quot; target=&quot;`_blank`&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://goo.gl/8REUMj&quot; alt=&quot;Flower Looking Plants&quot; title=&quot;Flower Looking Plants&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the hike- we decided to visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://goo.gl/v4wv1T&quot; target=&quot;`_blank`&quot;&gt;Soup Dumpling Plus&lt;/a&gt; in Fort Lee- which I gave them a 4-star rating on Yelp. A friend of ours had mentioned quite a few times about having brunch here. We ordered 6 dishes and were pretty stuffed. The scallion pancakes- pan fried pork buns and pan fried pork dumplings were my favorite. They were crispy and tasty. Some of the buns and dumplings were very juicy- which was a hit or miss. The pork fried rice was on the dry side and lack of flavor. Eggplant with garlic sauce was too sweet and not spicy at all. I had much better steamed pork soup dumplings in Chinatown. These had thicker skins- less meat and lack of flavor.&lt;/p&gt;
